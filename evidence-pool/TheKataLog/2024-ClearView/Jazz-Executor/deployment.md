Creating a deployment diagram that incorporates Kubernetes (K8s) for the ClearView application on AWS adds a layer of orchestration and container management. Here's how the architecture can be visualized with K8s components integrated into the AWS cloud.

### AWS Deployment Diagram with Kubernetes for ClearView

#### Components

1. **AWS VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)**
   - **Description**: Provides a private network for hosting the application components securely.
   - **Subnets**: Public and private subnets.

2. **Load Balancer (AWS ELB)**
   - **Description**: Distributes incoming traffic to multiple instances of application servers deployed on K8s.
   - **Type**: Application Load Balancer (ALB) for HTTP/HTTPS traffic.

3. **Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)**
   - **Description**: Managed Kubernetes service for running the containerized application components.
   - **K8s Components**:
     - **Pods**: Each representing individual application components.
       - **User Management Pod**: Node.js application.
       - **Candidate Management Pod**: Python application.
       - **Employer Management Pod**: Ruby on Rails application.
       - **DEI Consultant Pod**: Django application.
       - **Notification Pod**: Microservices for notifications.
       - **Analytics Pod**: Apache Spark processing.
       - **Compliance Pod**: HashiCorp Vault and monitoring services.
     - **K8s Services**: Expose the Pods to the Load Balancer for external access.

4. **RDS (Relational Database Service)**
   - **Description**: Managed database service for storing application data.
   - **Type**: PostgreSQL or MySQL, depending on the component requirements.

5. **S3 (Simple Storage Service)**
   - **Description**: Object storage service for storing candidate resumes and reports.
   - **Usage**: Used for storing static files, backups, and analytics reports.

6. **CloudFront**
   - **Description**: CDN (Content Delivery Network) to deliver static content with low latency.
   - **Usage**: Distributes assets (like images, CSS, and JavaScript files).

7. **SNS (Simple Notification Service)**
   - **Description**: Manages the notifications sent to users (via email/SMS).
   - **Usage**: Integrates with the Notification Pod.

8. **CloudWatch**
   - **Description**: Monitoring service for AWS resources and applications.
   - **Usage**: Logs application performance and alerts for any anomalies.

9. **IAM (Identity and Access Management)**
   - **Description**: Manages user access and permissions for AWS resources.
   - **Usage**: Role-based access control for different application components.

### Descriptions of Interactions

1. **Load Balancer**: Receives incoming HTTP/HTTPS traffic and distributes it across the EKS Pods.
2. **EKS Cluster**: Hosts the application Pods, each representing a different component of the ClearView application.
3. **RDS**: Provides centralized data storage for all application components, enabling them to query and update user data.
4. **S3**: Used for storing user-uploaded resumes and analytics reports, accessible by the application Pods.
5. **CloudFront**: Delivers static content to users, reducing latency and improving performance.
6. **SNS**: Sends notifications to users based on actions triggered in the application (e.g., job match notifications).
7. **CloudWatch**: Monitors the health and performance of the application Pods, generating alerts based on predefined thresholds.

### Conclusion

This AWS deployment diagram with Kubernetes provides a comprehensive view of how the ClearView application is structured in the cloud, utilizing containerization and orchestration for scalability and flexibility. By leveraging AWS services and Kubernetes, the architecture can be made resilient, scalable, and secure to meet the application's needs. You can create this diagram using a diagramming tool to visualize the setup effectively.
