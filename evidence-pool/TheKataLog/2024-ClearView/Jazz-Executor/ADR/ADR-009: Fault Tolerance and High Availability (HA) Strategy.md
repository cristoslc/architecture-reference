### **ADR-009: Fault Tolerance and High Availability (HA) Strategy**
- **Status:** Draft


#### **Context:**
Ensuring high availability and fault tolerance is crucial to maintain uninterrupted service during failures. ClearView must implement strategies to handle outages gracefully and provide minimal downtime for critical components.

#### **Evaluation Criteria:**
- Service uptime: Maintaining 99.9% availability.
- Fault isolation: Preventing failures from cascading across components.
- Disaster recovery: Ability to recover from data center failures within minutes.

#### **Options:**
1. **Active-Passive Replication**
   - Pros: Lower cost, simpler configuration.
   - Cons: Potential downtime during failover.

2. **Active-Active Multi-AZ Deployment**
   - Pros: Higher availability, zero-downtime failover.
   - Cons: Increased cost and complexity.

3. **Service-Level Redundancy**
   - Pros: Fault isolation for individual services.
   - Cons: Complexity in managing redundancy at the service level.

#### **Decision:**
Active-Active Multi-AZ deployment using Kubernetes clusters across multiple availability zones was selected to meet the high availability requirements.

#### **Implications:**
- Positive: Zero-downtime failover, high resilience.
- Negative: Higher operational complexity and cost.

#### **Consultation:**
- Discussed with cloud architects and site reliability engineers to validate HA requirements.
