   - **Status**: Decided
   - **Context**: Requirement for secure user authentication and authorization.
   - **Evaluation Criteria**: 
     - **Security**: Protection against unauthorized access and data breaches.
     - **Ease of Implementation**: Speed of integration into existing systems.
     - **User Experience**: Minimal friction for end-users during authentication.
