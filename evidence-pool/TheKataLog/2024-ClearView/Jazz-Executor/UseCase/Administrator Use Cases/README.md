2. **Configuration Service** processes the request and updates settings.
3. **Configuration Database** stores the updated settings.

#### 2.5 Components Involved
- **API Gateway**
- **Configuration Service**
- **Configuration Database**

#### 2.6 Storage Estimation
- **Storage Requirement**: Approximately 1 KB per configuration setting. For 100 settings = 100 KB.

#### 2.7 Failover Considerations
- Implement replication for the Configuration Database to ensure high availability.

#### 2.8 CAP Consideration
- **Consistency**: Ensure all components read the same configuration values.
- **Availability**: Configuration service should be operational at all times.
- **Partition Tolerance**: Use a distributed architecture for the configuration service.

### 3. Use Case: Generate Reports

#### 3.1 ADR
- **Decision**: Use a reporting service to aggregate data for generating reports.
- **Rationale**: Separate reporting logic allows for optimized performance and scalability.

#### 3.2 API
- **Endpoint**: `GET /api/admin/reports`
  - **Request Parameters**:
    ```json
    {
      "reportType": "string",  // e.g., usage, performance
      "dateRange": "date"
    }
    ```
  - **Response**: Generated report data in JSON or PDF format.

#### 3.3 Characteristics
- **Automation**: Reports can be generated on a schedule or on-demand.
- **Detailed**: Reports provide insights into various metrics and KPIs.

#### 3.4 Data/Operation Flow
1. **Administrator** requests a report through the API.
2. **Reporting Service** processes the request and aggregates necessary data.
3. **Report Database** stores the generated report.

#### 3.5 Components Involved
