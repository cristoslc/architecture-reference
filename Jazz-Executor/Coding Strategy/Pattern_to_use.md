To implement ClearView's core components efficiently, it's essential to select the appropriate coding patterns and algorithms. This will ensure scalability, maintainability, and performance, especially considering AI-powered services, event-driven architecture, and distributed systems. Here’s an overview of coding patterns and algorithms relevant to the various ClearView components:

### 1. **Coding Patterns by Component**

#### 1.1 **Anonymization Service**
- **Pattern**: **Decorator Pattern**
  - **Reason**: The decorator pattern can be used to modify existing resume parsing functionality with anonymization logic without altering the core parsing workflow.
  - **Flow**: 
    - Resume data is parsed.
    - Anonymization decorator is applied to remove PII.
    - The result is sent back for further AI processing or storage.
  - **Example**:
    ```python
    class ResumeParser:
        def parse(self, resume_text):
            # Core parsing logic
            return parsed_data

    class AnonymizerDecorator:
        def __init__(self, resume_parser):
            self.resume_parser = resume_parser

        def parse(self, resume_text):
            parsed_data = self.resume_parser.parse(resume_text)
            anonymized_data = self.anonymize(parsed_data)
            return anonymized_data

        def anonymize(self, parsed_data):
            # Anonymization logic here
            return anonymized_data
    ```

#### 1.2 **Resume Parsing and Recommendation Service**
- **Pattern**: **Strategy Pattern**
  - **Reason**: Allows for flexible integration of different resume parsing and recommendation algorithms depending on input data or customer-specific rules.
  - **Flow**:
    - Based on the type of resume, a different parsing strategy is chosen (e.g., NLP-based, rule-based).
    - After parsing, different recommendation strategies (AI-based or heuristic) are applied.
  - **Example**:
    ```python
    class ResumeParser:
        def __init__(self, strategy):
            self.strategy = strategy

        def parse(self, resume_text):
            return self.strategy.parse(resume_text)

    class NLPParserStrategy:
        def parse(self, resume_text):
            # NLP-based parsing logic
            return parsed_data

    class RuleBasedParserStrategy:
        def parse(self, resume_text):
            # Rule-based parsing logic
            return parsed_data
    ```

#### 1.3 **Notification Service**
- **Pattern**: **Observer Pattern / Event-Driven Architecture**
  - **Reason**: Event-driven architecture allows notifications to be sent automatically when a specific event occurs, such as job application status changes or interview scheduling.
  - **Flow**:
    - When an event occurs, observers (notification services) are notified, and the relevant notification is sent.
  - **Example**:
    ```python
    class EventManager:
        def __init__(self):
            self.subscribers = []

        def subscribe(self, subscriber):
            self.subscribers.append(subscriber)

        def notify(self, event):
            for subscriber in self.subscribers:
                subscriber.update(event)

    class NotificationService:
        def update(self, event):
            # Send notification based on event
            send_notification(event)
    ```

#### 1.4 **Job Matching Service (AI)**
- **Pattern**: **Chain of Responsibility**
  - **Reason**: Multiple steps are involved in job matching, such as parsing resumes, analyzing job descriptions, scoring, and suggesting jobs. The Chain of Responsibility allows each step to process the input and pass it along to the next.
  - **Flow**:
    - Resume data is processed through multiple stages (e.g., parsing, AI-based matching, scoring).
  - **Example**:
    ```python
    class MatchingHandler:
        def __init__(self, next_handler=None):
            self.next_handler = next_handler

        def handle(self, resume, job_desc):
            result = self.match(resume, job_desc)
            if self.next_handler:
                return self.next_handler.handle(resume, job_desc)
            return result

        def match(self, resume, job_desc):
            # Matching logic here
            return score
    ```

#### 1.5 **Feedback Service**
- **Pattern**: **Template Method Pattern**
  - **Reason**: Standardizes the workflow for collecting and processing feedback, with some steps customizable depending on the type of feedback (anonymous or not).
  - **Flow**:
    - A common template is used to collect feedback.
    - Depending on feedback type, it’s processed differently (e.g., anonymized or not).
  - **Example**:
    ```python
    class FeedbackTemplate:
        def submit_feedback(self, feedback):
            feedback = self.collect_feedback(feedback)
            feedback = self.process_feedback(feedback)
            self.store_feedback(feedback)

        def collect_feedback(self, feedback):
            # Feedback collection logic
            return feedback

        def process_feedback(self, feedback):
            # Optional processing (anonymization, etc.)
            return feedback
    ```

#### 1.6 **Job Application Service**
- **Pattern**: **Command Pattern**
  - **Reason**: Each job application or interview scheduling request can be encapsulated as a command. This allows for reusability and the ability to queue or undo operations.
  - **Flow**:
    - Users submit a job application, which is treated as a command and processed asynchronously.
  - **Example**:
    ```python
    class ApplyJobCommand:
        def __init__(self, job_id, user_id):
            self.job_id = job_id
            self.user_id = user_id

        def execute(self):
            # Logic for applying to a job
            pass

    class JobApplicationService:
        def apply(self, command):
            command.execute()
    ```

### 2. **Algorithms by Component**

#### 2.1 **Resume Matching Algorithm**
- **Algorithm**: **Cosine Similarity (NLP-based)**
  - **Use**: To compare job descriptions and resume content.
  - **How It Works**: Uses vectorization of job descriptions and resumes and calculates the cosine of the angle between them. The closer to 1, the better the match.
  - **Example**:
    ```python
    from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
    from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity

    def match_resume_to_job(resume, job_desc):
        vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()
        vectors = vectorizer.fit_transform([resume, job_desc])
        cosine_sim = cosine_similarity(vectors[0], vectors[1])
        return cosine_sim
    ```

#### 2.2 **Anonymization Algorithm**
- **Algorithm**: **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**
  - **Use**: Detects and removes personal identifiable information (PII) from resumes.
  - **How It Works**: Uses pre-trained NER models to identify names, locations, and organizations and replaces them with placeholders.
  - **Example**:
    ```python
    import spacy

    nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")

    def anonymize_resume(resume_text):
        doc = nlp(resume_text)
        anonymized_text = ""
        for token in doc:
            if token.ent_type_ in ['PERSON', 'ORG', 'GPE']:
                anonymized_text += "[REDACTED] "
            else:
                anonymized_text += token.text + " "
        return anonymized_text
    ```

#### 2.3 **Recommendation Algorithm**
- **Algorithm**: **Collaborative Filtering**
  - **Use**: For recommending job roles or resume tips based on user behavior and preferences.
  - **How It Works**: Collaborative filtering analyzes similarities between users and jobs to make recommendations.
  - **Example**:
    ```python
    from sklearn.neighbors import NearestNeighbors

    def recommend_jobs(user_vector, job_vectors):
        model = NearestNeighbors(n_neighbors=5)
        model.fit(job_vectors)
        distances, indices = model.kneighbors([user_vector])
        return indices
    ```

### 3. **Failover and Resiliency**

#### 3.1 **Circuit Breaker Pattern**
- **Use Case**: To handle service failures gracefully and prevent cascading failures across services.
- **Flow**: If a service (e.g., AI matching) fails multiple times, the circuit breaker trips and stops further requests until the service is healthy again.
- **Example**:
  ```python
  class CircuitBreaker:
      def __init__(self):
          self.failure_count = 0
          self.max_failures = 5
          self.state = "CLOSED"

      def call(self, func):
          if self.state == "OPEN":
              raise Exception("Service unavailable")
          try:
              result = func()
              self.reset()
              return result
          except:
              self.failure_count += 1
              if self.failure_count >= self.max_failures:
                  self.state = "OPEN"
              raise

      def reset(self):
          self.failure_count = 0
          self.state = "CLOSED"
  ```

### 4. **Summary**

- **Coding Patterns**: Decorator, Strategy, Observer, Command, and Chain of Responsibility are used to modularize and make the components extensible and testable.
- **Algorithms**: Cosine Similarity, NER, and Collaborative Filtering are applied in resume matching, anonymization, and recommendations.
- **Failover**: Circuit Breaker ensures system resiliency, preventing overloading the system when a service is down.
